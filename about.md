I am currently a PhD student at Oxford Uni about social stratification and family relations. 
On the side, I am trying to dedicate as much time as possible to artistic project. 
This website gathers the various bits of art I produced these last few years. 

My main artistic interest is now images in motion. Most of my short-films are 
produced with no budget, mainly using friends and acquaintances as actors. In some cases, 
a big name or two in social sciences will do a cameo. 

I also been very much interested in writing, mostly poetry. I am not an English native and 
most poems will be in French. However, I am starting to experiment using both languages. 
Beside writing short movies, I started writing theater plays. I am more than happy 
to collaborate with playing companies or solo actors to either write a play or even monologues. 
Please do get in touch with me. 

Feel free to quote my poems in using the name of this website and my name (Giacomo Ecce). 
The poetry that is not mine is cited explicitly. 

I wish you a long poetic journey.
