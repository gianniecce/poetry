Let me share with you my poetry. Feel free to quote my poems in using the name of this website and my name (Giacomo Ecce). The poetry that is not mine is cited explicitly. I wish you a long poetic journey. 

Website created by [me](https://twitter.com/giacomoecce) using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme [pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) and hosted freely on [Github](https://github.com/).
